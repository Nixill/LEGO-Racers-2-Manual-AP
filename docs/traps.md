The following traps are present in this apworld. Here's more details about what they all mean!

# In general
A trap only applies for *one completed attempt of one race*, whether that attempt is successful or not. Unless otherwise specified, the trap takes effect the next race after you notice that it exists. If you finish a race without completing the challenge set forth by the trap, you must reset that race instead of marking its goal complete (and this counts as a death for death-links), and the trap still applies to the next attempt. If you successfully complete the challenge, but it makes you lose the race, you may reset the race *without* the trap.

# Item embargo
For the entire duration of a race, you must not use any items or brick boost. If you use items or brick boost, you must reset the race, even if the item doesn't hit any other racers.

# Freeze
This trap takes effect in a race *or* in a bonus game, **immediately** when spotted (at the start of the next race or bonus game, if you're not in one at that moment). You must hold the brakes, and no other keys, for 15 seconds.

# Destroy your car
At some point before the race is finished, you must completely destroy your car. You may finish the race on foot, or (if you do not have the "No pitstops!" trap) repair your car and continue by car.

# Hold talk
This trap takes effect in a race *or* in a bonus game that is *NOT* on Xalax, the next one after the trap is received. For the duration of that race or bonus game, the Talk button must be held. If an NPC begins a conversation, you may fast-forward the dialogue, but must not cancel it. If you do cancel it, you must talk to that NPC again.

*(Xalax is exempt from this trap because there are no NPCs to talk to during races or bonus games.)*

# No shortcuts
This trap takes effect only on a race that has shortcuts. You must not use those shortcuts. If you do, you must either backtrack through the shortcut and progress normally, or restart the race. (The definition of a shortcut is left up to the player. Be reasonable.)

# No pitstops
This trap takes effect on any race *except* Express Delivery (Sandy Bay 2). You must not use the pits at any time on the race. If you do, you must restart the race.

*(Express Delivery is exempt from this trap because it is the only race that forces the player to use the pits, as the starting line is within them.)*

# Drive in reverse
This trap takes effect *going into* the second lap of any race. You must cross the finish line in reverse, and continue driving in reverse until the lap timer reaches 15 seconds.
